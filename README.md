## Introduction

Welcome to GymBox, my first milestone project. In October 2022 I decided to challenge myself to complete a Full Stack Development course whilst working full time and fathering 2 young children. 

The goal of the GymBox website is to display my understanding of CSS and HTML and what I have learned so far. 

The Project is a full functioning static website built with CSS and HTML.

I document the steps I took to plan and create this website as well as where I got my inspirations from and sources of information.

## UX - User Experience Design

Designing and developing the project with the user's perspective in mind will make it easier to create a positive user experience. This way, the user is more likely to have an emotional response that is pleasant throughout the project.

The planning of the project is broken into 5 planes,

 - The Strategy Plane
 - The Scope Plane
 - The Structure Plane
 - The Skeleton Plane
 - The Surface Plane
 

## Strategy Plane

The objective of my project is to deliver a visually appealing website to the end users, which showcases comprehensive information about the gym's facilities, location, and accessibility. This way, the end users can have a seamless and pleasant experience while exploring the gym's offerings.

### Creator Stories

 - The project is user-friendly and easy to navigate
 - The text-rich nature of the project does not confuse or disorient the users
 - The project elicits a positive emotional response from users, such as 	learning or expanding their knowledge
 - All content on the page is cohesive, relevant and aligned, to avoid a sense of randomness or incongruity
 - The presentation of content is structured in a way that does not overwhelm or deter users from the moment they access the page.

With the strategy for user experience in place, a crucial step is to shift my focus to the users' perspective and understand how they would perceive and interact with the project. This way, I could ensure that their experience would be as positive and enjoyable as possible.

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

 - As a first time visitor, I want to be able to quickly understand the purpose and offerings of the website.
 - As a first time visitor, I want to have an intuitive and seamless navigation experience.
 - As a first time visitor, I expect the information I read to be reinforced or supported through elements such as quotes, stories, or images.
 - As a first time visitor, I want to have a positive visual experience, with a clean and organized layout and attractive design.
 - As a first time visitor,, I want to be able to easily access additional resources or support, such as FAQs or contact information.
 - As a first time visitor, I want to have a clear understanding of how to take the next step, whether it be making a purchase, signing up for a service, or obtaining more information.
 - As a first-time visitor, I desire a structured and organized presentation of information, rather than feeling overwhelmed by excessive information.
 
#### Returning Visitor Goals

 - As a returning visitor, I seek a convenient means of communication with the creator / owner, such as through social links or a contact page.
 - As a returning visitor, I desire the ability to easily access the schedule of the business in a seamless way.
 
Developing User Stories allows me to gain a deeper understanding of design and feature requirements, enabling me to conceptualize a more effective project.


#### Types of expected visitor goals

- As a busy professional: I want to be able to easily find the location, contact information, and be able to view the classes on the gym's website, so that I can plan my workout schedule in advance.

- As an amateur boxer: I want to be able to find detailed information about the gym's trainers and their specialities, so that I can choose the best instructor for my skill level.

- As a parent: I want to be able to view the class schedule to coordinate with my schedule and know when the classes are held.

I chose to develop a Boxing Gym website because of my personal interest and past experience as a fan of combat sports and a member of a boxing gym. My passion for the sport was influenced by my older brother, a big fan and trainer of boxing who has been teaching classes to kids for years. His background has given me valuable insight into what users might be seeking when visiting my website and has helped me with the creation of my User Stories.

This website is designed to offer information about our boxing gym while offering an effortless navigation and a user-friendly experience. I aim to do this without presenting too much information at once, which can often be overwhelming for users.

As a significant portion of our target audience is expected to access the site using their mobile devices, It must be a priority to create a responsive design. This will guarantee a smooth and seamless experience for all users, no matter how they choose to access the site.

## Scope Plane

To achieve my objectives for both user and developer goals in my strategic plan, I will incorporate specific features into my website such as:

 - Header and navigation bar, so users can easily navigate different pages of the website.
 - A section for core information about the gym.
 - A video showcasing the gym and its facilities.
 - A map to show users exactly where the gym is.
 - Downloadable Gym Schedule in PDF format.
 - A contact form for users to ask any questions they have.
 - Images of the gym and facilities on the relevant pages.
 - Links to social media and any other relevant pages.
 
## Structure Plane

I will be developing a 3 page website that offers a downloadable Gym schedule in PDF format. There will be a navigation bar at the header and footer of the page making it easy for users to know what page of the website they are on and also easy to navigate across the website. This will make it easy for users to find what they are looking for with the relevant pieces of information on the correct pages. The information included on this website will be informative and clear so there is minimal chance of a user becoming overwhelmed with information. 

- Information will be broken up into blocks with headings on the Homepage.
- Information on the Facilities page will be broken up with images and headers, so users can visualise the facilities / equipment they are reading about.
- There will be a simple contact form and contact number on the contact page for users to get in contact and ask any questions they may have.
