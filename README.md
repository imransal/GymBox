## Introduction

Welcome to GymBox, my first milestone project. In October 2022 I decided to challenge myself to complete a Full Stack Development course whilst working full-time and fathering 2 young children. 

The goal of the GymBox website is to display my understanding of CSS and HTML and what I have learned so far. 

The Project is a full-functioning static website built with CSS and HTML.

I document the steps I took to plan and create this website as well as where I got my inspiration from and sources of information.

## UX - User Experience Design

Designing and developing the project with the user's perspective in mind will make it easier to create a positive user experience. This way, the user is more likely to have an emotional response that is pleasant throughout the project.

The planning of the project is broken into 5 planes,

 - The Strategy Plane
 - The Scope Plane
 - The Structure Plane
 - The Skeleton Plane
 - The Surface Plane
 

## Strategy Plane

The objective of my project is to deliver a visually appealing website to the end users, which showcases comprehensive information about the gym's facilities, location, and accessibility. This way, the end users can have a seamless and pleasant experience while exploring the gym's offerings.

### Creator Stories

 - The project is user-friendly and easy to navigate
 - The text-rich nature of the project does not confuse or disorient the users
 - The project elicits a positive emotional response from users, such as   learning or expanding their knowledge
 - All content on the page is cohesive, relevant, and aligned, to avoid a sense of randomness or incongruity
 - The presentation of content is structured in a way that does not overwhelm or deter users from the moment they access the page.

With the strategy for user experience in place, a crucial step is to shift my focus to the users' perspective and understand how they would perceive and interact with the project. This way, I could ensure that their experience would be as positive and enjoyable as possible.

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

 - As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to quickly understand the purpose and offerings of the website.
 - As a first-time visitor, I want to have an intuitive and seamless navigation experience.
 - As a first-time visitor, I expect the information I read to be reinforced or supported through elements such as quotes, stories, or images.
 - As a first-time visitor, I want to have a positive visual experience, with a clean and organized layout and attractive design.
 - As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to easily access additional resources or support, such as a gym schedule or contact information.
 
#### Returning Visitor Goals

 - As a returning visitor, I seek a convenient means of communication with the creator/owner, such as through social links or a contact page.
 - As a returning visitor, I desire the ability to easily access the schedule of the business seamlessly.
 
Developing User Stories allows me to gain a deeper understanding of design and feature requirements, enabling me to conceptualize a more effective project.


#### Types of expected visitor goals

- As a busy professional: I want to be able to easily find the location, and be able to view the classes on the gym's website, so that I can plan my workout schedule in advance.

- As an amateur boxer: I want to be able to find detailed information about the gym's equipment and classes so that I can create a training schedule for myself.

- As a parent: I want to be able to view the class schedule to coordinate with my schedule and know when the classes are held.

I chose to develop a Boxing Gym website because of my personal interest and past experience as a fan of combat sports and a member of a boxing gym. My passion for the sport was influenced by my older brother, a big fan and trainer of boxing who has been teaching classes to kids for years. His background has given me valuable insight into what users might be seeking when visiting my website and has helped me with the creation of my User Stories.

This website is designed to offer information about our boxing gym while offering an effortless navigation and a user-friendly experience. I aim to do this without presenting too much information at once, which can often be overwhelming for users.

As a significant portion of our target audience is expected to access the site using their mobile devices, It must be a priority to create a responsive design. This will guarantee a smooth and seamless experience for all users, no matter how they choose to access the site.

## Scope Plane

To achieve my objectives for both user and developer goals in my strategic plan, I will incorporate specific features into my website such as:

 - Header and navigation bar, so users can easily navigate different pages of the website.
 - A section for core information about the gym.
 - A video showcasing the gym and its facilities.
 - A map to show users exactly where the gym is.
 - Downloadable Gym Schedule in PDF format.
 - A contact form for users to ask any questions they have.
 - Images of the gym and facilities on the relevant pages.
 - Links to social media and any other relevant pages.
 
## Structure Plane

I will be developing a 3 page website that offers a downloadable Gym schedule in PDF format. There will be a navigation bar at the header and footer of the page making it easy for users to know what page of the website they are on and also easy to navigate across the website. This will make it easy for users to find what they are looking for with the relevant pieces of information on the correct pages. The information included on this website will be informative and clear so there is minimal chance of a user becoming overwhelmed with information. 

- Information will be broken up into blocks with headings on the Homepage.
- Information on the Facilities page will be broken up with images and headers, so users can visualise the facilities / equipment they are reading about.
- There will be a simple contact form and contact number on the contact page for users to get in contact and ask any questions they may have.


## Skeleton Plane

Here is a link to the Wireframes I originally designed. The design has developed and changed since the Wireframes were created. I decided to change the tabs section at the bottom of the homepage to include a Google Map instead.

- [Homepage](https://imgbb.com/tX5C0t6)
- [Facilities](https://imgbb.com/FVCMPG1)
- [Gym Schedule](https://imransal.github.io/GymBox/assets/images/gymbox_timetable.pdf)
- [Contact](https://imgbb.com/GpKdCBq)

### Homepage Differences 

 - Navbar is centered instead of to the left as on the wireframe.
 - I decided to keep google maps on my Homepage but I also added a youtube video that does not play automatically.
 - I did not include a sign-up form in the hero image of the Homepage as I felt like this would clutter the homepage
 - I decided to replace the card section at the bottom of the wireframe with a google maps location section instead.

 ### Facilities Differences

 - I decided to change the layout of the facilities page. I found layering the text on top of the images gives a better aesthetic appeal to this page.
 - I decided to add an extra section at the bottom of the facilities page to inform users about the experienced trainers that are available at GymBox. I included an inline quotation box that responds to smaller screen devices as well.

### Contact Differences

- I decided to condense this form into fewer input boxes. I combined first name and last name and removed the option for a contact number.


## Surface Plane 

### Features

- NavBar - I have used a responsive NavBar that toggles into a burger bar menu that activates at a width of 991px. This is suitable for small and medium devices. I have styled the navbar to show the active page in a solid white, whilst the inactive pages are an off-white/grey color. I have used a hover effect so when the user hovers over a NavBar item it will highlight as the website themes 'dodgerblue' color. The Logo on the left-hand side of the NavBar provides a link back to the homepage.
- Hero Images - I have used hero images for the start of my pages. I have included a jumbotron with an opaque overlay so that the jumbotron text is clear. All of the hero images displayed on the site follow the same boxing theme and the images I have chosen feel like the same photographer took them all.
- Dark background - I decided to use a dark background to help users to strain their eyes less when viewing the webpage. Using a dark-themed website also helps content stand out and convey more of a powerful message to the site user.
- Dark colors and theme - I decided to go with a grey, white, and dodgerblue color scheme. The grey colors suit well with the combat sports industry. Grey provides a professional and modern feel whilst the dodgerblue color I chose helps to influence a calming feel whilst also being the color known to be honest, truthful, and sincere (Credits to [Color-Meanings](https://www.color-meanings.com/)).
- Light-colored fonts - I chose the Poppins font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) due to the professional sports look. I decided to go with white and dodgerblue colors for my hero image headers and content. This provides a nice contrast to the dark-themed backgrounds I have chosen.
- Quotations - I have used real quotations throughout the site. I have used a quotation on the home page that is fitting from Muhammed Ali where he mentions the word 'Impossible' does not actually exist. This is a relative quote as the site user is thinking about joining a boxing gym. I used another quotation from Muhammed Ali on my Facilities page which he mentions winning a battle is long before the event, but is won in the gym and in training. I have placed this quotation next to some content that is showcasing the experienced boxing trainers we have at GymBox.
- Footer - I used a footer from Opacity Code. I took inspiration from this footer as it met the requirements I designed in my wireframes. I included another navigation menu in the same style as my NavBar, including the colors and hover. I also included my social media icons with links to individual profiles that open in a new tab.

## Testing

In this section, I will test the user stories from the User Experience Design section in this README.md.

### User Story Testing

1. **As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to quickly understand the purpose and offerings of the website.**

* As soon as you enter the website you are introduced to a title that says "Welcome To GymBox" and a subtitle that says "The Number 1 Boxing Gym In The UK".

* Users are aware straight away that they are on the homepage of a boxing gym website.

![GymBox Homepage Hero Screenshot](/docs/User%20Story%20Images/Home-Page-Hero.jpg)

* As you scroll down you can easily see 3 subheadings with more information, headed "Boxing Equipment", "Boxing Classes", and "Safe & Secure". This lets site users know straight away Gymbox has boxing equipment, and boxing classes and is a safe & secure site for members to attend. The priority of information has been thought about, giving the name of the Gym in the hero and then the Gym features right underneath.

### Bugs and Fixes

 - Hr dividers spanning across the whole section, I want them to be short and thick. CSS not updating the style.
   - Added margin: 0 auto; to hr and fixed my problem. Credit to [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

 - Hero image on Home Page only shows the boxer's arm on a mobile device.
   - Re-positioned image to the right-hand side so the image is now in a position that I like on mobile devices.

 - Space was too big between maps and quotation from Muhammed Ali.
   - Realised there was another <div> between maps and quotation, so deleted accordingly.
 - Jumbotron header is too big on mobile and tablet devices.
   - Added @media only screen and (max-width: 768px) to style.css to stipulate header should be 2rem and subheader should be 1rem to keep the header on one line.
 - Page content headers are too big on smaller devices.
    - Added @media only screen and (max-width: 768px) just like the jumbotron headings and made the page content headers to a size that looks better on smaller devices.
 - Images on the facilities page scaling incorrectly on smaller devices.
    - Credit to StackOverflow, I reviewed my resume project for the grid alignment on the features section. I used col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 and the website now responds well on smaller devices now.
 - Headings on the facilities page on mobile devices protruding above the image container.
      - Increased image view height to 60 in CSS. Looks good on all screens now
 - Images on facilities page not in good position - cannot see whole images.

 - Quotation box on facilities page kept stacking on top of content on smaller screen devices instead of underneath.
      - Re-arranged content and formatted using col 6.
 - Headers too big on mobile devices, protruding out of containers.
     - Fixed by resizing headers using media query.

## Deployment

### How to deploy a GitHub Repository using GitHub Pages

1. Go to your Repository section in GitHub and select the Repository you want to deploy.
2. Click on the Settings link on the top horizontal Menu.
3. Now on the settings page, find the Pages link, about halfway down, on the menu on the left-hand side.
4. Under Branch, select the dropdown that says None, select Main, and then click save. 
5. Wait for the page to refresh. Once the page has refreshed you can scroll back up and on the GitHub Pages Section you should see a message that says Your site is live at (Link to Live GitHub Pages Website) The live site does not usually publish straight away and sometimes takes a few minutes to become live.

### How to Fork the GitHub Repository

Forking a GitHub repository allows you to make a copy of the original repository that you can make changes to without affecting the original repository.

1. Go to the GitHub repository you wish to make a Fork of.
2. At the top of the page, opposite the repository name there is a button that says Fork.
3. Now you have a copy of the repository in your GitHub account. You can find it in your repositories section.
